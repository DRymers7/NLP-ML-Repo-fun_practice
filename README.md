# Welcome to my practice repository!

## Overview
This is simply a practice repository for me to hone my skills in ML, neural networks, NLP, etc. during my career transition. All data used in these practice projects is public domain.

## Layout
Each subsection of projects are organized by branch. You can find some practice projects with NLP, neural networks, etc. simply by navigating to the corresponding branch.

## Intention
While this does not constitute every project I've ever done, it is simply a way for me to continue to improve and learn in my free time, and show off projects that belong wholly to me and present no complication in showing to potential employers.

I hope you enjoy!
