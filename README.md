Some fun datasets/ ML projects that I wanted to work on to hone my skills and keep learning while transitioning between career paths. These are fairly simple projects designed to help me work on the foundational knowledge surround ML and quickly identify/address skillsets that I need to pick up.

Please feel free to drop a note if there are suggestions on how to do things more effeciently and more effectively!
